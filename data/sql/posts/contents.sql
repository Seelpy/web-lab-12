The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness—a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.\nBut there was life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind. The sled was without runners. It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested on the snow. The front end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it. On the sled, securely lashed, was a long and narrow oblong box. There were other things on the sled—blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot and frying-pan; but prominent, occupying most of the space, was the long and narrow oblong box.\nIn advance of the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man. At the rear of the sled toiled a second man. On the sled, in the box, lay a third man whose toil was over,—a man whom the Wild had conquered and beaten down until he would never move nor struggle again. It is not the way of the Wild to like movement. Life is an offence to it, for life is movement; and the Wild aims always to destroy movement. It freezes the water to prevent it running to the sea; it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their mighty hearts; and most ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into submission man—man who is the most restless of life, ever in revolt against the dictum that all movement must in the end come to the cessation of movement.\nBut at front and rear, unawed and indomitable, toiled the two men who were not yet dead. Their bodies were covered with fur and soft-tanned leather. Eyelashes and cheeks and lips were so coated with the crystals from their frozen breath that their faces were not discernible. This gave them the seeming of ghostly masques, undertakers in a spectral world at the funeral of some ghost. But under it all they were men, penetrating the land of desolation and mockery and silence, puny adventurers bent on colossal adventure, pitting themselves against the might of a world as remote and alien and pulseless as the abysses of space."),
       (2, 'From Top Down', 'Once a year, go someplace you\'ve never been before.', 'static/img/from-top-down.png', 'Mountain', "As a traveler, I firmly believe that the best way to learn about the world is by experiencing it firsthand. Every time I embark on a new journey, I am reminded of how much there is to see and learn in this world. Recently, I went on a trip that took me from the top of a mountain down to the bottom of a valley. It was an exhilarating journey that left me with memories I will cherish for a lifetime.\nThe journey began at the top of a mountain where I found myself surrounded by snow-capped peaks and breathtaking views. I had always dreamed of standing on top of a mountain and taking in the beauty of the world below. As I looked out at the vast expanse of wilderness, I felt a sense of awe and wonder. It was a moment of pure serenity that filled me with a sense of gratitude for the opportunity to experience such a beautiful place.\nAs I made my way down the mountain, I was struck by the stark contrast between the snowy landscape at the top and the lush greenery at the bottom. It was a reminder that even within a single journey, we can experience vastly different environments and cultures. The descent was a thrilling adventure as I navigated through rocky terrain and rushing streams. The journey down was just as rewarding as the climb up, and I felt a deep sense of satisfaction as I reached the valley floor.\nThroughout the journey, I was reminded of the importance of trying new things and stepping outside of our comfort zones. Every time we take a chance and explore something new, we open ourselves up to incredible experiences and opportunities. Traveling allows us to broaden our horizons and gain a deeper understanding of the world around us.\nIn conclusion, my journey from top to bottom was a reminder of the beauty and wonder that exists in our world. It was a journey that left me with memories I will cherish for a lifetime. I encourage everyone to take the time to go somewhere they've never been before, and to experience all the amazing things our world has to offer. Only by exploring new places and trying new things can we truly appreciate the vastness and diversity of our planet."),
       (3, 'Still Standing Tall', 'Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.', 'static/img/still-standing-tall.png', 'Forest', "As a traveler, I’ve been to many different places and have seen countless stunning sights. However, there’s one journey that always stands out in my mind - a trip to the Sequoia National Park in California.\nThe Sequoia National Park is home to some of the tallest trees in the world, including the General Sherman Tree, which stands at an impressive 275 feet tall. As I walked through the park, I couldn’t help but feel small in comparison to these towering giants.\nBut what struck me even more than their size was their resilience. Many of these trees have been standing for thousands of years, through wildfires, storms, and even human interference. They are still standing tall, despite everything they’ve faced.\nThis trip served as a reminder to me that even when life gets tough, we can still stand tall and weather the storms. We may face obstacles and challenges, but if we stay strong and keep pushing forward, we can overcome anything.\nAs a traveler, I believe that journeys aren’t just about seeing new places and experiencing new things - they’re also about learning and growing as a person. And this trip to the Sequoia National Park taught me a valuable lesson about resilience and perseverance.\nSo whenever I feel overwhelmed or discouraged, I think back to those towering trees and remind myself that I too can stand tall and weather any storm that comes my way."),

This time around, I decided to explore some of the lesser-known corners of Southeast Asia, starting with the islands of Indonesia.\nMy journey began in Bali, where I was greeted by the warm sunshine and the sound of waves crashing on the shore. I spent my days exploring the island's many temples, hiking through lush jungles, and trying out delicious local cuisine. But it wasn't until I made my way to the small island of Nusa Penida that I truly experienced the sunny side of this journey.\nI had heard about the stunning beaches and crystal-clear waters of Nusa Penida, but nothing could have prepared me for what I saw. As I stepped off the boat and onto the island, I was greeted by a sea of turquoise blue that stretched out as far as the eye could see. I couldn't wait to dive in and explore these pristine waters.\nOver the next few days, I spent my time swimming with manta rays, exploring hidden coves and caves, and lounging on secluded beaches that seemed to go on forever. With each passing day, I found myself more and more enamored with the natural beauty of Nusa Penida.\nBut it wasn't just the natural wonders that made this journey so special. I also had the pleasure of meeting some of the warmest and most hospitable people I have ever encountered. From the street vendors who served up delicious nasi goreng (fried rice) with a smile, to the locals who welcomed me into their homes and shared stories of their culture and traditions, the people of Nusa Penida left a lasting impression on me.\nAs my journey came to a close and I boarded the ferry back to Bali, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the sunny side of this journey. It was a journey full of surprises and delights, where I discovered the beauty and warmth of a place that had been hiding in plain sight all along.\nIf you're looking for a new adventure, consider exploring the sunny side of Southeast Asia. You might just find yourself falling in love with a place you never knew existed."),

The way they cascade down from the heights, the sound they make as they hit the rocks, the spray they create as they splash into the pools. They are nature's wonders, and we are drawn to them like moths to a flame. We travel to see them, to feel their power and beauty, to immerse ourselves in their freshness and vitality. We travel not to escape life, but for life not to escape us."),

Ever since I was a kid, I dreamed of exploring new places and cultures. But nothing prepared me for the experience of visiting Iceland last year. It was like stepping into another world.\nThe first thing that struck me was the landscape. It was so diverse and dramatic. There were volcanoes, glaciers, waterfalls, geysers, hot springs, and black sand beaches. Everywhere I looked, there was something amazing to see.\nBut the most memorable part of the trip was hiking in the misty mountains. It was early morning and the fog was thick. I could barely see a few meters ahead of me. I felt like I was walking in a dream.\nAs I climbed higher, the mist started to clear and I saw the most breathtaking view. The sun was rising over the horizon, painting the sky in shades of pink and orange. The mountains were covered in snow and ice, reflecting the light. And below me, there was a valley with a river and a lake.\nI felt so small and insignificant in that moment. I realized how vast and beautiful the world is, and how much there is to discover. I felt humbled and grateful for being able to witness such a wonder.\nTraveling has changed my perspective on life. It has made me more curious, open-minded, and adventurous. It has also made me appreciate what I have and where I come from.\nI hope to travel more in the future and see more of this amazing planet. And I hope you do too. Because travel makes you see what a tiny place you occupy in the world."),

There is something magical about the morning light, the fresh air, and the quiet streets. I like to wander around without a destination, just following my curiosity and intuition. I discover new places, meet new people, and learn new things. I feel alive and free. Waking up early is not a sacrifice, it's a gift. It's a way of living fully and authentically."),

Have you ever felt curious about other cultures, languages, and cuisines? Have you ever dreamed of exploring new places and meeting new people? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you should try traveling. Traveling is not only fun and exciting, but also educational and enriching. It can broaden your horizons, challenge your assumptions, and inspire your creativity. It can also help you grow as a person, develop new skills, and discover new passions. Traveling is not something you should do once in a while, but something you should do always. Because the world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.");
